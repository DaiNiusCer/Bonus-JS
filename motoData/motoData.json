      "paragraph": "Its engine was slightly larger than that of the XR600R, which debuted in 1985. The 97 x 80 mm bore engine was enlarged to 100 mm and stroked to 82mm for 644cc. With 44 horsepower at 6,000 RPM, the engine had 53 lbf⋅ft of torque at 5,000 RPM. A gear-driven counterbalancing system helped to smooth out vibrations created by the large single-cylinder engine. The compression ratio of 8.3:1 for the four valves was aided by a single chain-driven overhead camshaft. The intake was via a 40 mm Keihin constant-velocity carburettor, reaching as low as 5.2 L/100km (45 mpg) from 12.8 liters (3.4 gallons) in the tank. The bike featured a dry-sump (frame carries oil supply) engine.",

      "paragraph": "In 1996 the DR650SE was introduced, replacing the previous models. The engine was radically redesigned, reducing its power but allowing for more smooth delivery. The 2010+ SE model has the factory option of lowering the seat height by 40 mm for shorter riders. This involves lowering the front and rear suspension. A shorter side stand is also needed. The SE seat is narrow and firm. The SE has no tachometer but with standard gearing will cruise comfortably at 110–115 km/h. It has digital electronic CDI ignition and a coated cylinder bore to reduce weight. The exhaust pipe is made of stainless steel painted black to stop rusting. For a single cylinder bike, it is quite smooth due to the effective balancer shaft. The 40 mm Mikuni BST40 carb gives smooth power flow. It has electric-start only. The 21-inch front tire gives good directional control on gravel roads but is still fine for fast riding on sealed roads with the standard tires. ",
